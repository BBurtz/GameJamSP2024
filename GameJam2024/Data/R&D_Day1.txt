TEST SUBJECT A
RESEARCH LOG
DAY 1
------------------------------------------
Experimental research has begun regarding the (REDACTED) program. Our first test subject, codenamed (REDACTED), has not responded positively to our initial trials of the (REDACTED) augmentation.

Subject has shown signs of both physical and mental distress in response to the augmentation, such as restlessness, a heightened sensitivity to pain, and general disorientation.

However, the (REDACTED) implementation procedure was a technical success. Our method of installation appears promising. Further refinement of the (REDACTED) is required.

- Author's note: If each of our subjects react this poorly, we'll soon run out of them. Improving the biological compatibility of the (REDACTED) is my top priority
