RE: To all employees - about reinstanting cameras
------------------------------------------
Hello NuMed employees,

Recently, we've had a power outage which automatically turned off the security cameras we've had in place. In order to combat this issue, all employees are now allowed to use their employee ID numbers to personally reinstantiate power in case of emergency or lack of maintenance crew.

Thank you and have a great Nu day,
NuMed HR;
