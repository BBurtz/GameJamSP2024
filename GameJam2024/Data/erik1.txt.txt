Sorry, still getting used to this interface--the hardware is so advanced.

Anyways, I'm so excited about my first day at NuMed. At first it was very scary because there are so many big wigs here, but they all seemed very nice. Apparently, I'm working with Dr. Shelley as their personal assistant. Isn't that rad?

Whoops, almost forgot that my first shift starts in 5 minutes. Guess I took too long trying to figure out how to use this computer. Anyways, I bid you adieu!;
