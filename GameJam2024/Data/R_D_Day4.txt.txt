TEST SUBJECT B-285
RESEARCH LOG
DAY 4
------------------------------------------
Since my last research log, Subject A has... expired. The adverse side effects of the (REDACTED) implementation proved to be too intense for the subject, causing it to (REDACTED).

A modified prototype of the (REDACTED) was tested on Subject B, and despite my inital concerns, the subject has not shown any of the same reactions as Subject A.

Unfortunately, despite our efforts, Subject B does not appear to be responsive to our verbal commands. More... intense methods will follow
