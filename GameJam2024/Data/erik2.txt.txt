Sorry it's been so long since the last log. 
I'm working extremely hard at my job-- 
they're practically working me to the bone here!... 
eugh. Thankfully, Dr. Shelley appreciates my efforts. 
So that's cool, I guess. We're tight.

Supposedly there are rumors going around that 
Dr. Shelley is working with NuMed with some big entity. 
It's a bit spooky, no? Perhaps that's why they're 
so busy all the time... Seems like important stuff.

Oh, also... Good news! I found out how to insert images to these files!...
Unfortunately I looked HORRIBLE in my company photo so here's a picture of my id-badge that contains a GOOD picture of me. Appearances matter, yknow?;
