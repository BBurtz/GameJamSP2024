MY PERSONAL JOURNAL (3) - PRIVACY, PLEASE!
------------------------------------------
So some cool stuff happened recently. I'm writing this down so I don't forget. I guess it can work as a journal entry.

All these rumors recently have peaked my interest regarding on the (supposedly) big project that NuMed is working on. I wish they told me what was going on in the company because, yknow, I'm a worker too. So, I decided to do some digging while Dr. Shelley was preoccupied and found some files within Dr. Shelley's computer-- I don't they'll mind. I'm merely just taking a little peek. I'm sure it's nothing, anyway.

Although these files are... strange to say the least. What exactly is Dr. Shelley working on? Something about bio-modifications? I wonder if it's related to prosthetic research other people have been working on in the company... But even then some of the stuff written here is just.. odd. I'll keep digging write down anything of note on my next entry.

P.S.: Dr. Shelley has been saying some really weird stuff recently over the communications radio. I'm going to confront them about it next time I see them-- see what's going on. For now, I think I'll just stick to the music on the radio. It's nice.;
