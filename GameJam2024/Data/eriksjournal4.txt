I don't know what I signed up for when I started looking in these documents, but ****... I never thought it would be this. The files, the documents, everything within Dr. Shelley's computer is... beyond inhumane. 

How deep does this rabbit hole go? I cannot begin to understand, but what I do know from these files is that these trials run by Dr. Shelley are mortifiying. NuMed is experimenting on what seems to be (at least in the documents) living human subjects and torturing them to make genetically enhanced beings with the government... 

What does the government want with genetic enhanced beings? How long has this "project" been running for?

It seems theres a code related to these "things"... I think it's 1818? Regardless, I will continue to write more in secret. Stay tuned.
